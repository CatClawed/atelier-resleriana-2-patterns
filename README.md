Reverse engineering for Resleriana Red White.

Requirements:
* [Just](https://just.systems/) and Bash (unless you wanna rewrite the scripts)
* [Imhex](https://imhex.werwolv.net/)
* The game files, in a folder called `textasset`. You will have to get this yourself. I give some assistance [here](https://github.com/CatClawed/AtelierDatamining/tree/main/%5BA25-2%5D%20RW).

To use, just run `just extract` or `just scenario`
